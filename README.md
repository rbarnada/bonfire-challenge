### Challenge Objective:

Take the attached photoshop document and turn it into a single working web page. You can build in any way that you want and using any framework that you want (or no framework at all). The links on the page don’t need to go anywhere so you can set the href attribute to “#”.

### Challenge Requirements:
1.  The final page should work across all screen sizes from a full width desktop screen to a 320px wide phone.
2.  The final page should work across modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
3.  The tabs that say “all”, “even”, and “odd” should show/hide the appropriate boxes below. It should start off with “all” selected and all boxes showing.
4.  We’ve included an example of what the boxes should look like when the user hovers over one.
